**PyFileCoder - YARA rules generated by malware genomic analysis**

This folder contains Yara rules automatically generated by MAGIC for a cluster of malware called PyFileCoder (Python FileCoder).

The rules were generated using just two samples:
    c624e82cbc90bc0703ac98b05428221e484a8564
    c6cfbe0781137ed1c1bb94d10653da410b0e7ccf


MAGIC used the following procedure selection criteria:

   - Select clones,
   - with between 5 and 50 blocks, and
   - between 10 and 100 instructions, and
   - between 50 and 100 bytes

MAGIC selected 13 shared functions that matched this criteria. Published in this report are two version of rules generated by MAGIC. The two versions differ in the condition sections where it gives the number of selected procedures that should be present in the binary to be considered matched.

   - Version v1: Requires all of the selected procedures to be present
   - Version v2: Requires ANY one of the selected procedures to be present

Clearly rule v1 is more strict than v2.
