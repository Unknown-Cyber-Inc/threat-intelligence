**Unnamed malware - YARA rules generated by malware genomic analysis**

This folder contains Yara rules automatically generated by MAGIC for a cluster of malware with the same name. We couldn't discern its name from the labels given by AV. It is likely this not a prominent malware family.

The rules were generated using the following samples, though we have

MAGIC used the following procedure selection criteria:

   - Select clones,
   - with between 5 and 50 blocks, and
   - between 10 and 100 instructions, and
   - between 50 and 100 bytes

MAGIC found 39 shared functions that matched this criteria. Published in this report are two version of rules generated by MAGIC. The two versions differ in the condition sections where it gives the number of selected procedures that should be present in the binary to be considered matched.

   - Version v1: Requires any 7 of the 20 selected procedures to be present
   - Version v2: Require that ANY one of the selected procedures to be present

Clearly rule v1 is more strict than v2.

A scan of malware collection by one of our partners found that both the rules catch the same files, and both do not trigger any FP.
