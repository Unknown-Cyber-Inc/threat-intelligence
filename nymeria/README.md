**Nymeria - YARA rules generated by malware genomic analysis**

The rules were generated using a single (yes, just one file):

      f784e4328a810c63d00a7e94620cb2bc96e418ce

MAGIC used the following procedure selection criteria:

   - Select clones,
   - with between 5 and 50 blocks, and
   - between 10 and 100 instructions, and
   - between 50 and 100 bytes

MAGIC selected 200 shared functions from the original (packed) malware and 53 from the unpacked.

There are two Yara rules, both use the same selected procedures. They differ in the conditions in how the select the number of procedures that should match.
   - Version v1: Requires a subset (greater than one) of the  selected procedures to be match.
   - Version v2: Requires ANY one of the selected procedures to be present

So rule v1 is slightly more strict than v2. 

##CONTENTS##

   - CythMAGIC_nymeria_v1.yar: A bit stringent rule. 
   - CythMAGIC_nymeria_v2.yar: Most relaxed rule.
   - CythMAGIC_nymeria_payload_v1.yar: A bit stringent rule. 
   - CythMAGIC_nymeria_payload_v2.yar: Most relaxed rule.
