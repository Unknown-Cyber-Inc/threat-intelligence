**Nymeria - YARA rules generated by malware genomic analysis**

This folder contains Yara rules automatically generated by MAGIC for Nymeria. MAGIC generated two sets of rules: one for the original (packed) malware and one for its payload (unpacked).

The rules were generated using a single (yes, just one file):

      f784e4328a810c63d00a7e94620cb2bc96e418ce

MAGIC used the following procedure selection criteria:

   - Select clones,
   - with between 5 and 50 blocks, and
   - between 10 and 100 instructions, and
   - between 50 and 100 bytes

MAGIC selected 200 shared functions from the original (packed) malware and 53 from the unpacked. Published in this report are two version of rules generated by MAGIC. The two versions differ in the condition sections where it gives the number of selected procedures that should be present in the binary to be considered matched.

   - Version v1: Requires some (not all) of the selected procedures to be present
   - Version v2: Requires ANY one of the selected procedures to be present

Clearly rule v1 is more strict than v2.

A scan of malware collection by one of our partners found that both the rules catch the same files, and both do not trigger any FP.
