MAGIC used the following procedure selection criteria:

   - Select clones,
   - with between 5 and 50 blocks, and
   - between 10 and 100 instructions, and
   - between 50 and 100 bytes

MAGIC found 20 shared functions that matched this criteria.

It then generate two version of rules. The versions differed on the number of selected procedures that should be present in the binary to be considered matched.

   - Version v1: Requires any 7 of the 20 selected procedures to be present
   - Version v2: Require that ANY one of the selected procedures to be present

Clearly rule v1 is more strict than v2.

A scan of malware collection by one of our partners found that both the rules catch the same files, and both do not trigger any FP.

   - CythMAGIC_petya_v1.yar: A bit stringent rule. Requires at least seven of the common procedures to be present for a match
