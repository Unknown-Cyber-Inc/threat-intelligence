MAGIC used the following procedure selection criteria:

   - Select clones,
   - with between 5 and 50 blocks, and
   - between 10 and 100 instructions, and
   - between 50 and 100 bytes
   - and a coverage of 80-100%

MAGIC selected 10 shared functions that matched this criteria.

It then generate two version of rules. The versions differed on the number of selected procedures that should be present in the binary to be considered matched.

   - Version v1: Requires any 3 of selected procedures to be present
   - Version v2: Requires ANY one of the selected procedures to be present

Clearly rule v1 is more strict than v2.
