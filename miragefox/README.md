# MirageFox - YARA rules generated by malware genomic analysis

The MirageFox sample form several clusters. There may be multiple clusters because of one more of the following reasons:

1. Different architectures: Binaries for different architecture, such as, x86, ARM, MIPS, etc, form separate clusters.
2. Different Operating System: Binaries for different os, such as, Windows, Linux, or particular versions of these OS, form separate clusters.
2. Different components: A malware may have multiple components, such as, DLLs, each forming a separate cluster.
3. Far removed variant: Or the malware variants may be so different that they get placed in different clusters.
