**VPN Filter - YARA rules generated by malware genomic analysis**

On May 23, 2018 [Talos Security published an analysis](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/05/VPNFilter.html)
of VPN Filter malware. Amongst the many IoCs,  the document published hashes of 12 malware binaries. 
We analyzed these binaries using Cythereal MAGIC and generated Yara rules for detecting 
the malware.  This folder presents the results. 

##CONTENTS##

* yara/ - contains yara rules. There is one rule per clusters found by MAGIC in the 12 files
* bindiff/ - a csv file per cluster. Each row is a procedure. It gives RVAs of matching procedure between files in a cluster.
* matches/ - a csv file per cluster. Akin to bindiff files, but for malware binaries matched by a yara rule
