**WannaCry (cluster 4) - YARA rules generated by malware genomic analysis**

This folder contains Yara rules automatically generated by MAGIC for WannaCry. 

The rules were generated using a cluster of the following 8 samples.

MAGIC used the following procedure selection criteria:

   - Select clones,
   - with between 5 and 50 blocks, and
   - between 10 and 100 instructions, and
   - between 50 and 100 bytes
   - and a coverage of 80-100%

MAGIC selected 31 shared functions that matched this criteria. Published in this report are two version of rules generated by MAGIC. The two versions differ in the condition sections where it gives the number of selected procedures that should be present in the binary to be considered matched.

   - Version v1: Requires any 3 of the selected procedures to be present
   - Version v2: Require that ANY one of the selected procedures to be present

Clearly rule v1 is more strict than v2.
